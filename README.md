# Design-Patterns-TypeScript

Implements 23 GoF design patterns in TypeScript

## Creational patterns

These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code

- [FactoryMethod](https://github.com/furuya123/Design-Patterns-TypeScript/tree/main/04%20-%20FactoryMethod%20Pattern)
- [Singleton](https://github.com/furuyad/Design-Patterns-TypeScript/tree/main/05%20-%20Singleton%20Pattern)
- [Prototype](https://github.com/furuyad/Design-Patterns-TypeScript/tree/main/06%20-%20Prototype%20Pattern)
 
## Structural patterns

These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient

- [Adapter](https://github.com/furuya123/Design-Patterns-TypeScript/tree/main/02%20-%20Adapter%20Pattern)

## Behavioral patterns

These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects

- [Iterator](https://github.com/furuya123/Design-Patterns-TypeScript/tree/main/01%20-%20Iterator%20Pattern)
- [TemplateMethod](https://github.com/furuya123/Design-Patterns-TypeScript/tree/main/03%20-%20TemplateMethod%20Pattern)
